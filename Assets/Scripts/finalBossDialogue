So you must be the warrior sent to destroy me... Have they told you? I use to be
an adventurer like you, sent here to destroy the Evil Lord. My will was strong,
I stood where you stand now. He was facing me as I face you. I fought Him and
defeated Him...
Can't you see? You can't win. Walk away now and we shall live both, but you will
have failed your quest. Die crushed by my hand and all that will not matter
anymore. Defeat me... defeat me and the Crystal will have your soul and you will
serve it, new master of Evil, spreading your dark wings over the lands.
So, what will you choose?
